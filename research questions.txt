The project wants to investigate what intersections would look like and what rules would govern them in a scenario that involves autonomous cars that move indipendently.
Investigating this area, we would like to run some software simulations that may asnwer some of the research questions 

is there the need for communication?
	if yes, 
		would that be better if it were centralized or de-centralized (or both to some extents)?
		(wireless traffic signals from an external actor (centralized) or cars communicating with one another)
			eventually, to what extent would the cars need to communicate information, instead of just sensing?
	if no,
		would it be enough to use sensors on the cars and apply general rules for precedence and priority in one (or more) purposely designed intersections?
		are there intersections formats that would be more ideal than others? ( e.g. roundabouts?)
