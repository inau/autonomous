\item Presentation of our model.
\item Intersection w/wo traffic lights. Cars going straight vs. cars turning.
\item Car model and sensor modelling (sick vs simplified directional).
\item Graph for navigation.
\item Reactive controller.
\item Special rules (right hand).
\item Sensor range limitation based on braking distance considerations.
\item SimScale to RealWorldScale
