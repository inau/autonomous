\section{Unity3D project}
The project has been built using Unity3D version 5.2.
While newer versions might be able to run the simulation, we can guarantee that it does run on this version.\\

\subsection{Install}
The project can be found on github following this url: \url{https://github.com/inau/autonomous/tree/master/Intersection/IntersectionManagement2D}.\\
This is a subdirectory so cloning should be done from the parent directory.\\
When importing into the game engine use the folder 'IntersectionManagement2D'.\\

\noindent
Unity projects contain a 'ProjectSettings' folder and an 'Assets' folder. The assets contain all the interesting stuff.
Our simulation has been structured into 'Core' package and 'Control' package.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Core}\\
\noindent
This package has two folders, one which contains the essentials for modelling the intersection and another which contains the essentials for cars.\\
The intersection directory has Origin and destination points, graph representation and an intersection file which combines these components to make up an intersection.\\
The car directory contains interface for car movement and sensors.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Control}\\
This folder has controllers for our car model. It contains the reactive controller and older simpler versions.
