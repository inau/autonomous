This project aims to investigate some of the aspects involving traffic management with autonomous vehicles.
In particular, we want to know how it can be possible to regulate self driving cars through an intersection, and if it is possible to achieve this without a centralised controller and the use of communication.
We built a simulation environment using the Unity3D game engine. We tried different representations of intersections and designed a reactive controller.

We gathered data describing throughput, collisions and deadlocks.
%The controller we built performs worse than the compared centralised solution from Texas University.
%The strength is that by going pure reactive we avoid having a single point of failure planning mechanism.
The system we developed doesn't achieve the same performance of centralised solutions, 
but we will compare results and discuss about the different approaches.
The main goal of the project is the development of a system that is purely reactive, without the single point of failure of centralised solutions.
Our solution is intended as a fallback for when systems relying on communication fail.
