This project aims to investigate in some of the aspects involving traffic management with autonomous vehicles.
In particular, we want to know how it can be possible to regulate self driving cars through an intersection, and if it is possible to achieve this without a centralised controller and the use of communication.
We will run a simulation of an intersection with self driving cars and discuss our findings, comparing different methodologies and related work.
