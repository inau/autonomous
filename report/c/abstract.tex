This project aims to investigate some of the aspects involving traffic management with autonomous vehicles.
In particular, we want to know how it can be possible to regulate self driving cars through an intersection, and if it is possible to achieve this without a centralised controller and the use of communication.
We built a simulation environment using the Unity3D game engine. We tried different representations of intersections and designed a reactive controller.
The data we gathered described throughput, collisions and deadlocks.
The controller we built performs worse than the compared centralised solution from Texas University.
The strength is that by going pure reactive we avoid having a single point of failure planning mechanism.
