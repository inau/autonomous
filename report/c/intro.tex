%A presentation of previous research (related work), different paragdigms of control (basic theory), and our angle.
The idea of having autonomous agents has existed in science fiction litterature for hundreds of years and can also be traced back to ancient mythology.
The ideas and concepts of autonomous agents are hence not something entirely new, but rather something that has been refined over the course of alot of years.
However the technology has just recently reached a state where alot of the underlying challenges to autonomous agents can be solved somewhat efficiently.

In this paper we will focus on what it takes to make autonomous automobiles efficient in intersections.

Initially we had a look at what other researchers had been doing the recent decade and quickly realised that there was a pattern. 
The same groups keep appearing in the litterature when having the focus on autonomous vehicles and intersections.

To put everything in context we will start by presenting some of the challlenges that are present when trying to efficiently solve the task of managing vehicles in an intersection.
Followed by different control paragdims. These paragdims will be presented in relation to existing solutions to emphasize how practical applications of these abstract paragdims can look.
