we have some fixed parameters such as light control on or off. Mimics intersection lights.\\
Whether simulated vehicles are able to turn or not.\\
We have different max speeds - 60 or 40 km per hour approach. This translates to lower speeds during turns (roughly half).\\

tests are different combinations of above parameters. And results are measured in collisions, cars spawned, cars reaching destination, and time before deadlock.\\
Deadlock is the situation where cars have been stuck for a period of time in the `intersection zone' without entering or leaving.
