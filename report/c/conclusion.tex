The reactive approach can be seen as a stepping stone to achieve autonomy.
The nature of the controller makes more advanced schemes more complex to incorporate.
Our controller is an example of how far you can get with subsumption architectures - we did collision avoidance and built right hand rule onto that.

While our systems performance is comparable to AIM, it is nowhere near as good.
The throughput is lower. Our system can deadlock.
This naturally implies that we have room for improvement.
With additional work put into the controller, it should be achievable to design a controller which does not collide.

Despite the fact that it performs poorly compared to other systems, its strength is the omission of centralised control. Centralised control introduces a construct prone to single point of failure.

The vision was that pure reactive control should provide a safer way to traverse intersections with less sources for errors.
