Advanced Traffic Management Systems - it is a system where technology is integrated
in a management perspective with the goal of improving traffic flow and safety.
Traffic data is collected from sensors (e.g. cameras, speed sensors..) and analysed 
in real time by a centralized Transportation Management Center, which may result in actions taken 
with the goal of improving traffic flow.
