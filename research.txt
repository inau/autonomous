Advanced Traffic Management Systems - it is a system where technology is integrated
in a management perspective with the goal of improving traffic flow and safety.
Traffic data is collected from sensors (e.g. cameras, speed sensors..) and analysed 
in real time by a centralized Transportation Management Center, which may result in actions taken 
with the goal of improving traffic flow.

Active Traffic Management - ("smart lanes") is a method of increasing capacity and smoothing traffic flows
in use on some busy highways. Techniques include variable speed limits, hard-shoulder running and 
ramp-metering controlled by overhead variable message signs

AIM - Autonomous Intersection Management (centralized system)
The system assigns permissions to cross the intersection to the approaching vehicles, based on their 
trajectory on a first comes first served basis.

Light Traffic
Intersection management system without traffic lights, for autonomous cars.
Cars adjust their speed approaching to the intersection, so they don't have to stop at all.
It is a slot based system, in which cars will arrive at the intersection exactly when there is a slot
available for them to cross it.



Existing tools
--------------
AIM GNU General public license
gazebo - platform for robot simulations


open questions
--------------

what if there are both autonomous cars and human drivers involved?
what about pedestrians?
what about bike lanes?
(not yet found: decenttralized approach)

proposal:
work incrementally, starting from a purely reactive system (safenet layer) and building on top of it,
adding communication between cars, and maybe pedestrians, bikes and or other.
