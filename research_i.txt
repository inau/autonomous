Texas university has a Traffic management system (TMS), that is called AIM (autonomous intersection management).
This project aim's to create a scalable, safe, and efficient multiagent framework for managing autonomous vehicles at intersections.

However it seems as if the system does not take into acount other types of traffic than autonomous vehicles - ie. bicycles or pedestrians.
Their AIM4 simulation tool only takes into account autonomous vehicles.
