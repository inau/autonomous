	0. chhose deadlines, so we can actually have some work done
	
	1. build pure reactive cars (simulation)
		choose tools, environment, design, do the work
		(gazebo, game engines, java...)
		
		alternative 1:

		1.1 basic car model by 26/09 with all the functions to move + intersection model
		1.2 GUI, just for testing (maybe car controls with user input just for this time) by 3/10
		1.3 basic sensoring part on the car, possibly obstacle avoidance or at least start - stop logic and right hand rule by 10/10

		alternative 2:

		1.4 research existing tools and/or environments and choose one
		1.5 do 1.1 and 1.2 in one week by 26/09 or 3/10

	2. send them against each other in an intersection and measure stuff

	3. communication part (to be designed)
